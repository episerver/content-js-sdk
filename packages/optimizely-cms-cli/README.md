# Optimizely CMS CLI

> [!WARNING]
> We are excited for the beta release of our SaaS CMS CLI app. This will be a growing set of tools to model, fetch, and render your content in SaaS CMS. This repository is still in beta and should not be used in production environments. We would appreciate any and all feedback as we work towards general availability.

## Get started

This package works better when used with the JavaScript SDK. [Read the instructions in GitHub](https://github.com/episerver/content-js-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file)
