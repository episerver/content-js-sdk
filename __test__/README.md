# Integration tests

This directory include projects (application, scripts, etc) that tests the SDK and CLI against a CMS

Structure:

- `/cli-test`: tests that the CMS-related logic works
- `/cli-runtime-test`: test for the runtime side of the CLI (not related to the CMS). For example, the CLI works in different developer environments
