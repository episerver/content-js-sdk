[![npm version - CLI](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@optimizely/cms-cli)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@optimizely/cms-cli)

The official JavaScript SDK and CLI from the Optimizely CMS team. Build headless applications with Optimizely CMS the right way—with full TypeScript support, intelligent code completion, and end-to-end type safety so you can ship faster with confidence.

**What's included:**

- **SDK** - A comprehensive JavaScript/TypeScript library for fetching, rendering, and managing content from Optimizely CMS in your applications
- **CLI** - A command-line tool that syncs your TypeScript content type definitions to Optimizely CMS

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** 22 or higher
- **Git**
- **Package manager**: npm (comes with Node.js), pnpm, or yarn

> **Note:** While the SDK is designed to be framework-agnostic, this version currently includes first-class support for React and Next.js. Support for additional frameworks is coming soon.
